2. Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma, "every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. The best known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

	The alphabet used is ASCII, and case insensitive, from 'a' to 'z' inclusively.
    
    
3. Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

	An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter.

	Examples of isograms:

 	 ```

  	background
  	downstream
 	 ```
	The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.
    
4. Convert a long phrase to its acronym.

	Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

	Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).
    
5. Take a nested list and return a single list with all values except nil/null.

	The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.
	```
	For Example

	input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

	output: [1,2,3,4,5]
	
    ```
